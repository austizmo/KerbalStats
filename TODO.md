TODO List
Crunch numbers for Mun flight
how many high stress situations, of what durations, should a kerbal be able to withstand?
stupidity increases severity of stress test failure
if badass, decrease chance of mental break

v1
UI Design
	-better kerbal list entry boxes, no more on hover
	-replace text readouts of total/current stress with meter graphics (text overlay?)
	-hook into game notification messages on important events (high stress, past breaking point, failed test)
Balance Tuning
Stress Triggers
	-crew death
	-collision
	-bedlam
	-nearby explosion
Situation Modifiers
	-docking (speed/distance to taget)
	-distance from home
	-time alone
	-time with crew
	-unstable orbit
	-g level
	-livable space to crew ratio
	-remaining delta v
	-remaining electric charge
Mental Break Actions
	-eva
	-failure to respond
	-random burn
	-increase crew stress
	-dump resources
	-undock craft

v2
Astronaut Complex Integration
CLS Integration
	-VM: CLSSpace integration
TAC Integration
	-VM: life support level
	-ST: life support depleted
	-MBA: dump food
	-MBA: contaminate food
RemoteTech Integration
	-ST: loss of contact with mission control
Parts
	-sleeping quarters
		-allow resting
	-cryo chamber
		-allow long term sleep
	-gravity ring
		-removes g stress
